Also, lately people have been stealing my skins! Do I have to put DNC/No inspo just for that to not happen? Like please don't copy my oc/cos, besides,i don't put the name of my cosplays in my user, and earlier someone copied my Kirari cosplay even though they didn't even know it was a cos, so respectfully, don't copy my skins.

A rake of claws against a mirror
Grazing pelts we all once wore
A kindling of a swordless bloodshed
The creaking of a voiceless door
Where does a mind like yours wonder
When it's sung to sleep?
Mind the clamours of the restless bidders
Before you choose to weep
And the Hound is humming you
A lie, a lullaby
Stuck in the middle of a forest made of
Flesh and bones and they're all scared of
A lost little boy who has lost his heart
Fear's not enough, they have to tear him apart
Follow the scent of iron sinking
Deeper into corpses rotting
But they can't hear you talk, talk, talk
About every little thing, every little thing
Every
And the Hound is humming you
A lie, a lullaby
It clicks and it clatters in corners and borders
And they will never
Hear me here, listen to croons and a calling
I'll tell them all the
Story, the sun, and the swallow, her sorrow
Singing me the tale of the Harpy and the Hare
And the Hound is humming you
A lie
And the Hound is humming you
A lie, a lullaby
And the Hound hums
A lie, a lullaby
And the Hound hums
A lie, a lullaby
And the Hound is humming
And the Hound is howling
And the Hound is humming
You
And the Hound
A lie, A lullaby
And the Hound is humming you
A lie, a lullaby
Hmm, hmm, hmm-mm
