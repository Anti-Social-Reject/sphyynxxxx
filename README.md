Hii! Welcome to my profile! If you're looking for info about me click on sippingonzaza or something like that. You'll know it when you see it! 

I also have an oc introduction for my oc Quing! Click that if you want to! 

`"If you can't find the key, then you can find the door. If you can find the door, then you can find the lock, a lock, what will you do? A lock without a key, without eyes, it cannot see, beyond the seams but can you? You can see everything cant you.. Then why can't you find the key?"` 

The other one is a Spotify playlist, you don't have to click it but you can! ^_<

`"Your walking the same path every day .. Do you get tired? You walk the same path but you cannot tell me what the path is made of? Perhaps a rocky path, or a smooth path of dirt. If I asked you would lie and tell me the path as if its what you want to see. But you can't deny the fact that it isn't true, how do think that path feels after being walked on all the time..?"`
