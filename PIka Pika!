~~'Fearful of ones voice, do I even have a choice? Replaying such a temerarious rhythmic noise, 
the sound replaying like the boiling feeling within my frail joints, im following along with it for now, 
I don't know know how to live with it. It doesn't know I feel, how can it comprehend whats real? It isn't like me, 
its just another senseless thing. Why won't it listen to me, does it think im a joke?'~~!
